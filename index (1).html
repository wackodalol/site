<h2 > I'm going to keep documenting what i find after the situation. Flash is being discontinued this year so i have to be quick.</h2>
 <h2 >ENTRY #1: It's still unclear why or who was responsible for this much danger in this fun children's game, I merely investigated because of curiosity, but now it's haunting me.</h2>
<h2 >ENTRY #2: I have suspicion that this coorelates to something bigger, someone bigger. But who? Who is responsible for all this death on this server where no players have control over their penguin anymore?</h2>
<h2 >What if...</h2>
<h2 >It's the people we trusted the most?</h2>
<h2 >ENTRY #3: VGFGURNTRAGF!!! sorry, i slammed my head on my keyboard in frustration. still trying to get to the bottom of this.
my twitter page posted a penguin in severe danger, tied up. being tugged by a broken tuba. is there more i should know?</h2>
<h2 >Yeah, there is.</h2>
<h2 >Mass murder in the snow forts. </h2>
<h2 >But why?</h2>
<h2 >I might have to try launching things up again, i'll keep you updated.</h2>
<h2 >ENTRY #4:</h2>
<h2 >Fuck, fuck. everything is chaos.</h2>
<h2 >It won't boot up.</h2>
<h2 >i got some things found when extracting the swf files in that horrific Club Penguin server. two penguins sitting on a bench, one talking about how their lives are perfect, eating pizza, while the other one seems to be sweating, he looks like an epf agent...</h2>
<h2 >could the epf have something to do with this?</h2>
<h2>ENTRY #5: I've investigated further. I found tons of footage of an orange penguin wreaking havoc, but he isn't at the same time.
    In that same footage, there's a cannibal and an agent. both look oddly familiar.</h2>
    <h2>ENTRY #6: The final entry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can do at this point... This seems like a rabbit hole I've dug too deep into.
    </h2>
    <h2>bye.</h2>
